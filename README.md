# WTFortune
A program written in C++ on wxWidgets to display random fortune cookies for Windows.

It is similar to 'Wanda the Fish' program on Gnome. 

I had also hosted this program on Sourceforge in 2011!
http://sourceforge.net/projects/wtfortune/

The fortunes were taken from 
http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/all/fortunes-min/filelist.

#Usage
Extract the contents of the folder and move the WTFortune folder to any desired location. Click open the WTFortune.exe file and click on the settings button to point to the 'fortunes' folder. This will create a WTFortuneSettings.ini file in the same folder as the .exe. The WTFortuneSettings.ini file contains the location of the fortunes to be used by the program. If you delete this file, simply click on the settings button again to create one. To uninstall the program, delete WTFortune.exe and the fortunes folder.

To insert your own database of cookies, browse through the fortunes folder and add new files in the same format. 

To read the fortune cookies from the taskbar, simply right-click on WTFortune.exe and fix it to the taskbar!
